Roadmap
#######

The intent of the MingwPy developers is to expand this website and the MingwPy
project (code to build and distribute the compiler toolchain), and start using
it in the first half of 2016 as the default method to distribute Windows wheel
binaries for Numpy, Scipy and other scientific Python projects.

For more details, please see this proposal (which was accepted by both NumFOCUS
and the PSF in early Jan 2016):
