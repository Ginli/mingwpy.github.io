mingw-w64 FAQ
=============

Originally by Carl Kleffner.

What is mingw-w64
-----------------

mingw-w64 is a fork of the mingw32 project - see:
http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/mingw-w64/wiki/History

Why choose mingw-w64 over mingw
-------------------------------

- 32 AND 64bit support
- large file support
- winpthread pthreads implementation, MIT licenced.
- cross compiler toolchains available for Linux

Official mingw-w64 releases
---------------------------

Source releases of the mingw-64 repository
- http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/files/mingw-w64/mingw-w64-release/

Official mingw-w64 GCC toolchains
---------------------------------

'recommended' builds are available from the mingw-builds project at
http://mingw-w64.sourceforge.net/download.php#mingw-builds for example:

- http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/files/Toolchains%20targetting%20Win64/Personal%20Builds/mingw-builds/4.8.2/threads-posix/seh/
- http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/files/Toolchains%20targetting%20Win32/Personal%20Builds/mingw-builds/4.8.2/threads-posix/dwarf/

These are common combinations of exception and thread models. You can find other
combinations as well. Exception handling affects C++ development. Don't ever
link object code with different types of exception and/or thread handling!

-------------

msys2 is the successor of msys. Msys2 is necessary as environment for the mingw build process on Windows.
